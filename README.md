## Copilot Reflection
**How I used it:**
I used Copilot to generate the boilerplate for React Navigation and the FlatList structure. I prompted it with comments like "// Create a form with two inputs" to speed up the UI creation.

**Mistake & Fix:**
Copilot initially suggested passing data via a global variable. I fixed this by using React Navigation's `route.params` feature to pass data safely between screens.

**Speed:**
It significantly sped up writing the CSS Stylesheets. I only had to type "container" and it autofilled the flexbox properties.
